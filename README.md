# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

### Introduction 
- Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and different parts of the body controlled by nerves. Nearly 90,000 people in the U.S are diagnosed with Parkinsons disease each year, and over 10 million people in the world are living with Parkinson's Disease.

### Objective
- The primary objective of this project is to utilize machine learning models in Python to accurately detect Parkinson's disease.

### Dataset
- Dataset source : [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons)

### Tools
- [Python](https://github.com/jkim772/Parkinsons-Disease-Detection/blob/main/Parkinsons%20Disease%20Detection.ipynb)

### Machine Learning Models Trained
- Logistic Regression Model
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- Random Forest Model
- Support Vector Model
  
### Highlight
- Out of the four machine learning models, **Support Vector** had the highest accuracy rate of 87% of detecton in Parkinson's disease
